//MARK: - Steps for save and fetch functions:

//SAVE

//#1 Initialize new message object
//#2 Use a CloudKitManager function to save the message's CKRecords
//#3 Check for errors
//#4 If there are no errors, then append the message to the message array

//FETCH

//#1 Use a CloudKitManager function to fetch Message records from the right database
//#2 Check for errors in the completion
//#3 Take the records returned and initialize Message objects from them.
//#4 Set the newly created messages in the MessageController's array of Messages
